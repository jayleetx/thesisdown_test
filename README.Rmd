## Introduction

[`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) is the R Markdown template for Reed College's senior thesis. It's built on [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), a more general format for "authoring books and technical documents with R Markdown".

## Setup

1. Prerequisites: install [R, RStudio](https://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/resources/R/installr.html), and LaTeX ([Windows](https://miktex.org/download) | [Mac](http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)).

2. Open RStudio and install the `thesisdown` package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
if (!require("bookdown")) install.packages("bookdown")

remotes::install_github("ismayc/thesisdown")
```

3. Restart RStudio, create a new R Markdown document, and select the thesis format (*File / New File / R Markdown / From Template / Thesis*, on Mac). **Be sure to name the directory `index`**, or else it won't knit properly. Click *OK* to create the document.

You can also create this from the R Console with the following code, exchanging the file path for wherever you want the thesis to live.

```{r eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft(file = "~/Desktop/thesis/index",
                 template = "Thesis",
                 package = "thesisdown",
                 create_dir = TRUE,
                 edit = FALSE)
```

Again, **be sure to name the final folder `index`** to knit properly. The folder immediately above `index` must already exist in order for this to run without errors.

## File structure

The blank thesis template now lives inside of the `index` directory in your chosen file location, and contains the following files and folders:

- [`00--prelim.Rmd`](index/00--prelim.Rmd). Acknowledgements, preface, and dedication. Optional.

- [`00-abstract.Rmd`](index/00-abstract.Rmd). Abstract.

- [`01-chap1.Rmd`](index/01-chap1.Rmd). Chapter 1.

- [`02-chap2.Rmd`](index/02-chap2.Rmd). Chapter 2.

- [`03-chap3.Rmd`](index/03-chap3.Rmd). Chapter 3.

- [`04-conclusion.Rmd`](index/04-conclusion.Rmd). Conclusion.

- [`05-appendix.Rmd`](index/05-appendix.Rmd). Appendix.

- [`99-references.Rmd`](index/99-references.Rmd). Reference formatting, actual bibliography is generated from `bib` upon knit.

- [`_bookdown.yml`](index/_bookdown.yml). A YAML file to define how the multiple Rmd files are combined.

- [`bib`](index/bib). Contains a BibTeX file for citations. Replace with your own.

- [`chemarr.sty`](index/chemarr.sty). LaTeX macro creating some extra-long hooked arrows for chemistry reactions. Optional.

- [`csl`](index/csl). Contains a CSL file to define the APA format of citations. You can download CSLs for other citation formats [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles) to replace this one.

- [`data`](index/data). Folder for data. Optional.

- [`figure`](index/figure). Folder for images. Optional.

- [`index.Rmd`](index/index.Rmd). This is the "master" R Markdown file. Defines the front of the thesis: name, advisor, major, etc. Also includes the introduction.

- [`reedthesis.cls`](index/reedthesis.cls). Creates the thesis document class for LaTeX (do not edit).

- [`template.tex`](index/template.tex). LaTeX thesis template (do not edit).

You can write directly into the `index.Rmd` and numbered files. To create the actual thesis, pick which output you want in the `index.Rmd` YAML by commenting (#) out the lines for `output` that you don't want, then knitting (this defaults to GitBook, so you need to set it to PDF). After knitting for the first time, the following folders appear:

- `_book`. This contains the generated documents for the thesis: the PDF thesis, and the TeX file that generated the PDF (among other things).

- `_bookdown_files`. Contains caches and images created in the thesis document (plots, etc.).

The actual generated thesis lives at:

- [`_book/thesis.pdf`](index/_book/thesis.pdf) (PDF)

- [`_book/index.html`](index/_book/index.html) (GitBook)

- [`_book/thesis.docx`](index/_book/thesis.docx) (Word)

- [`_book/thesis.epub`](index/_book/thesis.epub) (EPUB)

Note that ONLY the PDF file actually complies to the thesis formatting requirements. The others are just extras.

R also creates some intermediate files in the knitting process, which are deleted when the knit completes. If this breaks along the way, this is where you can troubleshoot:

- `thesis.Rmd`. When the R code breaks and throws an R error, it will reference which line the error is on (or rather, which line the chunk containing the error starts on). The line number it cites is in relation to this file, which is the combination of the multiple chapter files that actually knits to directly become the thesis pdf.

- `thesis.log`. This is the TeX log file, which will detail any errors in the LaTeX formatting after the R code is done running. The bottom of this file usually has any errors, and the line numbers it cites refers to `thesis.tex`.

## Dealing with files

### `index.Rmd`

- Your introduction gets written directly into this file, under the "Introduction" header.

- Be sure to update the YAML header here! Name, date, division, advisor, department, title, output, acknowledgements, dedication, preface. These all need to be customized for your thesis.

- Double check that the files referenced for `bibliography` and `csl` are correct. If you change the citation format or have a differently named file, this needs to be updated.

- `lot` and `lof` are "list of tables" and "list of figures" respectively; leave these as true to match the thesis formatting requirements.

- To include extra LaTeX packages, uncomment lines 43-44 and change/add packages as needed.

### Adding, subtracting, or renaming chapters

By default, [`_bookdown.yml`](index/_bookdown.yml) handles the chapter ordering. The third line of this file (`rmd_files`) defines which files are combined to create the actual thesis document. You can add a chapter by adding it to the directory and this list, and delete one by removing it from the list. As long as the list matches what you want to have in your thesis and the correct file names, all should be well.

### Appendix

If you have code in one of the Rmd files that breaks the visual flow of the thesis but should still be included, the appendix is a good place to display this. For an example of how to do this, look at the `include_packages` chunk in [`index.Rmd`](index/index.Rmd) (starting on line 59). To hide this code, the `include = FALSE` option was set. The output of the chunk, if any is produced, will still be displayed.

The code is displayed using the chunk on line 16 of [`05-appendix.Rmd`](index/05-appendix.Rmd). It uses the name of the original chunk to duplicate it here, then sets `results = 'hide'` to only show the code and hide the output.

### Abstract and prelim

You may notice that two of the included files are [`00-abstract.Rmd`](index/00-abstract.Rmd) and [`00--prelim.Rmd`](index/00--prelim.Rmd) (for acknowledgements, preface, and dedication), but these sections are duplicated in the YAML of `index.Rmd`. This doubling is mostly an artifact of an attempted edit to the template that was never quite finished.

You can add your abstract directly to the `00-abstract.Rmd` file, and line 23 of `index.Rmd` will automatically include it in the document. For acknowledgements, dedication, and preface, yo should write directly into the YAML of `index.Rmd` (I wasn't able to figure out how to add the file like the abstract).

### File path issues

R Markdown has some non-intuitive behaviors when it comes to relative file names. A typical structure in R repositories is the Project (big P), which is meant to be a self-contained folder containing everything needed for a project (small p) you're working on. The working directory is generally set to the root of the Project, so relative file names are indexed to this location. When you knit an R Markdown document, however, it temporarily sets the parent directory of the Rmd file to be the working directory. This can mess up any relative file paths which ran fine in lin-by-line code tests (indexed to the Project), but are now breaking your knit (indexed to the Rmd file).

For example, maybe your `index` directory lives inside of an R Project foldered as `thesis`, with your data inside the subfolder `data`. When running code in the console, your data can be accessed through `data/file.csv`. When running it in the thesis Rmd file (inside `index`), however, R (correctly) recognizes that there is nothing at `index/data/file.csv` and will fail to read the file. You would then have to change your Rmd script to the file path `../data.file/csv`, but you then lose the ability to run it in the console.

Possible fixes:

- The `here` package, which standardizes relative file locations. After loading it once for the project (`library(here)`), using the command `here('data', 'file.csv')` (from the Project directory) in place of any call to `file.csv` will automatically use the correct relative path based on the current working directory. This is the best way to maintain reproducibility and portability in your analyses. It also abstracts this file reference problem away so you don't have to think about it!

- Place everything inside `index`. This is an option, but it can be useful to have thesis-related things outside of the `index` structure: data, Zotero libraries, etc.

- Use `setwd()` at the top of your Rmd file. This is bad because you can lose the ability to call things directly from the console, and any change in directory setup (new computer, RStudio server, etc.) will require a change - which is not a good reproducible practice.

- Use full absolute file paths all the time. Bad because of the same directory change as above (also gets tedious).

### YAML formatting

YAML ("Yet Another Markup Language", or "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a protocol for defining the metadata for a document: title, author, output format, whether there should be a table of contents, etc.

### Why does it have to be named `index`?

One of the formats you can knit your thesis to is GitBook, which is built on top of some HTML. This format is a webpage, so the "home" of the page needs to be called `index`. If you're only knitting to pdf, you can maybe change this, but it's best to leave it as is just in case...

### Underscore issues

A problem: R people really like underscores to separate words in object names (dots represent something else), but LaTeX doesn't like underscores (they're a special character, so displaying them verbatim is tricky sometimes). It's hard to anticipate every case where this is an issue, but the [`xtable` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf) is a good option for displaying a table that has underscores in column names or data.

One other issue is with code chunk names containing underscores. To reference a table in the text, [you can reference it](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/tables.html) with the name of the chunk that created it. If the chunk name has an underscore, however, the LaTeX reference created will break because of this. So avoid naming chunks with underscores if you're referencing tables this way.
